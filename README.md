# add-2-numbers
`add-2-numbers` is a next generation math library of the 21st century, fully hackable and customizable... no, no wait, that's not an Electron app... It's a *really* complex library written in Node.js for adding two numbers

This library uses very advanced and complex algorithms such as Bloom Filter, neural network back propagation algorithm and so on.

# Installation
Just make sure you have installed Node.js on your machine and run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install add-2-numbers
```
And it's done! How simple is that? Unfortunately the algorithm isn't as simple as the installation process of the package.

# Benchmarks
This method (now it's just deprecated) is around 1000x slower than my super-duper advanced algorithm!
```javascript
var a = 2;
var b = 2;
console.log(a + b); // It prints the result after 0.00001ms! That's incredibly slow!
```

# Usage
This method is around 1000x times faster than simple:

Finally the add-2-numbers package comes with help and now it prints the result after 0.000000001ms!
```javascript
const add2Numbers = require('add-2-numbers');

var a = 2;
var b = 2;
console.log(add2Numbers(a, b)); // Wow! Incredible! It's that simple, isn't it? And it's super fast!!!
```
But hold on... That's not the only feature this package comes with. You can also nest the operations!
```javascript
const add2Numbers = require('add-2-numbers');

var a = 2;
var b = 2;
console.log(add2Numbers(a, add2Numbers(a, b))); // You haven't seen that before, huh?
```
