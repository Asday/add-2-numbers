# add-two-numbers
A very complex library written in Node.js for adding two numbers

This library uses very advanced and complex algorithms such as Bloom Filter, neural network back propagation algorithm and so on.

This method is around 1000x times faster than simple:
```javascript
var a = 2;
var b = 2;
console.log(a + b); // It prints the result after 0.00001ms! That's incredibly slow!
```

Finally the add-two-numbers comes with help and now it prints the result after 0.000000001ms!
```javascript
const addTwoNumbers = require('add-two-numbers');

var a = 2;
var b = 2;
console.log(addTwoNumbers(a + b));
```
